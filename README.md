# GitHub Pages
A small website using GitHub pages to show all of my other projects in a nice and presentable way.
Can be viewed from https://floridaman7588.github.io

***
Website based off of CGVI cydia repo. Yes, I know I've really changed it a lot but it's still from them.
You  can find the original version [here](https://github.com/CGVI "CGVI repository")
